# Painless Experiment and Data Management at Scale for ML Projects

## Problem statement

Machine Learning development is complex. Here are some challenges for productionizing ML models:

- Tracking which data files were used for every round of training machine learning models.
- Tracking resulting trained models and evaluation metrics
- Simple method to share data files with colleagues via any form of file sharing system.
- Transparency
- Auditability
- Reproducibility
- Scalability

## Solution

Build an end-to-end ML platform using Open source technologies that support scalability, Reproducibility, Transparency and data management/versioning at Scale.

## Technologies
`Apache Airflow`, `Apache Spark`, `AWS S3`, `dvc`, `MLFlow`
